        <h2>Use Strong, Unique Passwords</h2>
        <p>Create complex passwords that are difficult for others to guess. A strong password includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable information like your birthday or family names. Most importantly, use a different password for each of your online accounts. If one account is compromised, this practice prevents attackers from accessing your other accounts, including your online banking.</p>

        <h2>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h2>
        <p>Multi-factor authentication adds a critical second layer of security to your accounts. Even if someone steals your password, they won't be able to log in without a second piece of information, such as a one-time code sent to your phone or generated by an authenticator app. We highly recommend enabling MFA on your banking portal and any other sensitive accounts whenever it is offered.</p>

        <h2>Beware of Phishing Scams</h2>
        <p>Be cautious of unsolicited emails, text messages, or phone calls asking for your personal or financial information. Scammers often create fake messages that look like they're from a legitimate company, like your bank, to trick you into revealing passwords, account numbers, or other sensitive data. Never click on suspicious links or download attachments from unknown senders. We will never ask you for your full password or PIN in an email or text.</p>

        <h2>Secure Your Devices and Network</h2>
        <p>Ensure the computer, tablet, or phone you use for banking is protected with up-to-date security software, including an antivirus and firewall. Always install the latest updates for your operating system and applications to patch security vulnerabilities. When accessing your bank account online, avoid using public Wi-Fi networks, which can be insecure. Use a trusted, password-protected network like your home Wi-Fi instead.</p>
